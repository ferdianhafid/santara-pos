# Santara POS - Project Status

## Current Deployment

* App has been deployed to Vercel and is working.
* GitHub default branch should be `main`.
* Future work must use `main` only.
* Do not push to `master`.

* Edit price
* Edit HPP
* Active/inactive menu
* Custom category dropdown
* HPP transaction snapshots
* Riwayat Struk
* Receipt detail
* Receipt reprint
* Branch mismatch was fixed, latest work is on `main`

## Important Current Limitation

* Data is still localStorage-first and browser-local, so it is not ready as a multi-device production database.
* Supabase schema preparation exists, but the app does not sync operational data to Supabase yet.
* There is no Google Sheets sync yet.
* There is no legacy import yet.

## Phase 5A Supabase Preparation

What exists:

* `@supabase/supabase-js` dependency is installed.
* `.env.example` documents the required Supabase environment variables.
* `src/lib/supabase.ts` creates a safe Supabase client only when env variables exist.
* `supabase/migrations/20260614000100_santara_pos_schema.sql` prepares tables for profiles, menu categories, menu items, transactions, transaction items, pending orders, pending order items, and app settings.
* RLS is enabled in the migration with simple authenticated-user policies for planning/testing.
* `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` explains setup steps for beginners.

What is still not implemented:

* The app has not replaced localStorage persistence yet.
* No Supabase data service or sync flow exists yet.
* No login/auth UI exists yet.
* No production role-based RLS policy has been finalized yet.
* No Google Sheets sync, legacy import, expenses, shift closing, or Excel export exists yet.

## Phase 5B Supabase Autosync

What exists:

* A local sync queue stores pending Supabase operations in localStorage.
* Important changes autosync when Supabase is configured: menu edits, completed transactions, pending order changes, and receipt counter updates.
* The app retries sync on load, when the browser comes back online, and when the compact `Sync Sekarang` button is clicked.
* Cloud data is pulled automatically on app load after pending local sync operations are processed.
* The header has a compact sync status indicator: Lokal, Tersinkron, Menyinkronkan, Menunggu, or Error.
* `supabase/migrations/20260614000200_santara_pos_phase5b_sync_policies.sql` adds temporary anon-key policies so autosync can work before auth exists.

What is still not implemented:

* No login/auth UI exists yet.
* No final owner/admin/cashier role policies exist yet.
* No complex conflict resolution exists yet.
* No Google Sheets sync, legacy import, expenses, shift closing, realtime subscriptions, or Excel export exists yet.

Next phase should be:

Phase 5C - Supabase Auth and Safer Role Policies

Goal:

* Add login/auth.
* Replace temporary anon sync policies with role-based owner/admin/cashier policies.
* Keep localStorage fallback and backup safety.

## Next Recommended Phase

The next phase should be:

Phase 5C - Supabase Auth and Safer Role Policies

Goal:

* Add login/auth.
* Replace temporary anon sync policies with role-based owner/admin/cashier policies.
* Keep localStorage fallback safe while Supabase is introduced.

## Future Roadmap

Phase 4 - Reports

* Monthly report
* All-time report
* Gross sales
* Discount
* Net sales
* HPP
* Gross profit
* Gross margin
* Expenses later
* Net profit later
* Payment summary
* Menu sales summary
* Best seller

Phase 5 - Legacy Sales Import

* Import old POS sales from CSV/XLSX
* Include legacy data in all-time reports

Phase 6 - Export and Google Sheets Sync

* Export CSV/XLSX
* One-click sync to Google Sheets

Phase 7 - Supabase/database

## Rules for Future Codex Tasks

* Always read `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` and `PROJECT_STATUS.md` before coding.
* Always work only on `main`.
* Never push to `master`.
* Always run build before and after changes.
* Always create/check a safe checkpoint before changes.
* Do not implement more than one phase at a time.
* Keep cashier UI simple.
* Do not add complicated inventory, membership, coupon, or promo automation unless requested.
* Preserve receipt print CSS.
* Preserve warm Santara UI style.
* Prefer small safe commits.

## Recommended Prompt Header for Future Tasks

“Work only in `Ferdian-99/santara-pos`.
Use branch `main` only.
Do not push to `master`.
Do not touch any other repository.
Read `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` and `PROJECT_STATUS.md` first.
Before changes, run git status, git pull origin main, and npm.cmd run build.
Do not continue if build fails or working tree is not clean.
Implement only the requested phase.
After changes, run npm.cmd run build, commit, and push to origin/main.”
